Hello! I am a developer with bachelor's degrees in Biomedical Engineering and IT Convergence Engineering. I have gained experience through various development-related courses and have completed two React projects during my employment at a company. I have a strong interest in frontend development and strive to understand projects through the flow between the backend and frontend. Collaboration and personal growth are values that I highly prioritize. I make efforts to grow and evolve together with my colleagues in projects.
